# Problem 1

## (a)

$\hat{\beta}x_i = \hat{\alpha}z_i$
$\hat{\beta} = c\hat{\alpha}$

$\hat{\alpha}_j = \frac{\hat{\beta}_j}{c}$


## (b)



## (c)



## (d)

I would say this is incorrect because the student forgot the $\epsilon$.

## (e)

False. You can make the training model whatever size you want.

## (f)

Unbiased means that if you did the experiment a large amount of times and calculate $\hat{\beta}$ for each of those times, the average of all the estimates would exactly equal ${\beta}$.

# Problem 2

``` {r}

#install.packages("ISLR2") #you only need to do this one time.
library(ISLR2) #you will need to do this every time you open a new R session.

```

## (a)

``` {r}

head(Boston)

set.seed(1)

n <- nrow(Boston)

train_index <- sample(1:n, floor(n / 2), replace = FALSE)


train_boston <- Boston[train_index, ]
test_boston <- Boston[-train_index, ]

m1 <- lm(crim ~ ., data = train_boston)

summary(m1)

trainMSE <- sum(m1$residuals^2)/nrow(train_boston)

trainMSE

test_predict <- predict(m1, newdata = test_boston)

test_MSE <- mean((test_predict - test_boston$crim)^2)

test_MSE

```

## (b)

``` {r}

set.seed(1)

n <- nrow(Boston)

train_index <- sample(1:n, floor(n / 2), replace = FALSE)


train_boston <- Boston[train_index, ]
test_boston <- Boston[-train_index, ]

m1 <- lm(crim ~ zn + indus + nox + dis + rad + ptratio + medv, data = train_boston)

summary(m1)

trainMSE <- sum(m1$residuals^2)/nrow(train_boston)

trainMSE
  
test_predict <- predict(m1, newdata = test_boston)

test_MSE <- mean((test_predict - test_boston$crim)^2)

test_MSE

```

The training MSE collected from part A was slightly smaller than the one from part B.
The test MSE collected from part A was slightly larger than the one from part B.

## (c)

I expected part b to have a larger MSE because it is being trained on less variables so it's not likely to be as good as part a that was trained on every variable.

## (d)



# Problem 3

## (a)

${\beta}_0 = 2$
${\beta}_1 = 3$
${\beta}_2 = 5$

## (b)


``` {r}

set.seed(1) # For reproducibility
X1 = seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)
X2 = runif(100)
epsilon = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)

Y = 2 + 3*X1 + 5*log(X2) + epsilon
Y
```

## (c)

``` {r}

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(X1, Y, main="X1 vs Y", col="blue", pch=19)
plot(X2, Y, main="X2 vs Y", col="darkgreen", pch=19)

```

## (d)

``` {r}

n_sim <- 10000
beta1_hats <- rep(NA, n_sim)

for(i in 1:n_sim) {
  # We generate new noise each time to simulate a new sample
  eps_sim <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)

  # Fit the model (using log(X2) since that is the true relationship)
  fit <- lm(Y_sim ~ X1 + log(X2))
  beta1_hats[i] <- coef(fit)[2]
}

mean(beta1_hats)

```

## (e)


``` {r}

abline(v = 3, col = "red", lwd = 3) # The true Beta1

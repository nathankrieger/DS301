## Bagging and Random Forests

#install.packages("randomForest")
library(randomForest)

## Even though I set seed, your results may differ from mine depending on your version of R and your version of randomForest package. 
set.seed(1)

## Bagging is a special case of a random forest with m = p. 
## Therefore, randomForest() function can implement both random forests and bagging. 

## Bagging
train = sample(1:nrow(Boston),nrow(Boston)/2)
dim(Boston)

### choose m using cross-validation (write your own code)
bag.boston = randomForest(medv~.,data=Boston, subset = train, mtry = 12, importance = TRUE, ntree=500)

importance(bag.boston)
# two measures of variable importance are report
# (1) %IncMSE: A larger value means a predictor is more important. 

# (2): IncNodePurity: for classification trees, this is the total decrease in node impurity (or increase in node purity) from splitting on a predictor, averaged over all trees. Measured by Gini index. 
#For regression trees, the node impurity is measured by the training RSS.

varImpPlot(bag.boston)

## test MSE
yhat.bag =  predict(bag.boston, newdata = Boston[-train, ]) 
boston.test = Boston[-train,"medv"]
plot(yhat.bag, boston.test)
abline(0, 1)

mean((yhat.bag - boston.test)^2)

#### Random Forest ####
## By default, randomForest() uses p/3 variables when building a random forest of regression trees, and sqrt(p) variables when building a random forest of classification trees. 

set.seed(1)
rf.boston = randomForest(medv ~., data = Boston, subset = train, mtry = 6, importance = TRUE, ntree = 500)

yhat.rf = predict(rf.boston, newdata = Boston[-train, ]) 
mean((yhat.rf - boston.test)^2)

importance(rf.boston)
varImpPlot(rf.boston)
